Bottom conveyor belt
- The bottom conveyor belt turns on iff there is a ball just outside of the conveyor belt. This should be the 
  only control needed for the bottom conveyor belt, except when shooting balls. If we are shooting balls, then the 
  bottom conveyor belt should move.

Top conveyor belt
- The top conveyor belt functions the same way as the bottom conveyor belt. It has a beam break sensor at the bottom that
  serves the same purpose as the beam break sensor at the front of the bottom conveyor belt. 
    - Like the bottom conveyor belt, the top conveyor belt should move when we are trying to shoot. Its speed should be
      adjusted such that the shooter has time to return to the correct speed before the next ball is shot.
- The exception that makes it different from the bottom conveyor belt is that it must stop if there is a ball at its top,
  unless we are trying to shoot.
  
  Shooter
  - Double ratio between the two wheel speeds, double mean wheel speed, and boolean steep shoot angle position with air 
    cylinder are associated with preset. There are 3 presets. It starts when the button corresponding to a preset is pressed.
